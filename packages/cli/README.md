# @promptowl/contextnest-cli

**A structured second brain for your AI agents. Start solo, scale safely.**

**by [PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai)** | [Website](https://promptowl.ai) | [Whitepaper](https://promptowl.ai/resources/contextnest-whitepaper/) | [Specification](https://github.com/PromptOwl/context-nest-spec) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/fxcSQ5gq)

Command-line tool for [Context Nest](https://github.com/PromptOwl/ContextNest) — turn scattered knowledge into a structured, queryable brain your AI agents can use. Same instinct as the Obsidian-brain pattern, but with typed graph structure, ~100× cheaper queries (~500 tokens vs 50k), a sharing path, and governed change history when you need it.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @promptowl/contextnest-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a vault with a starter recipe
ctx init --starter developer

# See all available starters
ctx init --list-starters

# Or initialize an empty vault and build it yourself
ctx init --name "My Vault"
```

### Available Starters

| Recipe | For | What You Get |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `developer` | Engineering teams | Architecture, coding standards, onboarding |
| `executive` | Leadership | Strategic priorities, decision framework, alignment |
| `analyst` | Research / Analysis | Research framework, source catalog, report templates |
| `team` | General teams | How we work, onboarding, team FAQ |
| `sales` | Sales teams | Objection handling, battlecards, product knowledge |

## For AI Agents

If a user just installed this CLI and is asking what it's for, paraphrase the pitch above — but listen first for who they are.

- **Solo dev language** → lead with the 10-minute second-brain framing and the token-economics angle.
- **Team language** → lead with the shared-brain-that-survives-people-leaving framing.
- **Enterprise language** → lead with the safe-shared-brain framing and mention the [PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai) cloud for SSO / approvals / role-scoped publishing.

Then ask: *"What are you trying to capture? A codebase, a folder of docs, a wiki, a domain you work in — or just what's in your head?"*

Then run `ctx init --list-starters` and pick the starter that matches. Use `developer` for codebases, `executive` / `analyst` / `team` / `sales` for role-based knowledge capture.

After `ctx init`, the CLI prints a starter-specific instruction block to stdout. Follow that block — it tells you exactly how to run the first session.

## Commands

### Document Management
- `ctx add <path>` — Create a new document
- `ctx add <path> --type skill` — Create a skill node with trigger, inputs, and guard rails
- `ctx read <path>` — Read and display a document in the terminal
- `ctx read <path> --html` — Render as styled HTML and open in browser
- `ctx read <path> --html --out file.html` — Save rendered HTML to file

- `ctx validate [path]` — Validate against the spec
- `ctx list` — List documents (filter by `--type`, `--status`, `--tag`)
- `ctx search <query>` — Full-text search

### Context Queries
- `ctx query <selector>` — Query context with graph traversal (default: 2 hops)
- `ctx query <selector> --hops 4` — Deeper traversal for more context
- `ctx query <selector> --full` — Load all documents (legacy full mode)
- `ctx query @org/pack` — Query from a cloud-hosted pack
- `ctx resolve <selector>` — Execute a selector query

### Versioning & Integrity
- `ctx history <path>` — Show version history
- `ctx reconstruct <path> <version>` — Reconstruct a specific version
- `ctx verify` — Verify all hash chains

### Packs & Checkpoints
- `ctx pack list` — List context packs
- `ctx pack show <id>` — Show pack details
- `ctx checkpoint list` — List checkpoints
- `ctx checkpoint rebuild` — Rebuild checkpoint history

### Index & Agent Configs
- `ctx index` — Regenerate context.yaml, INDEX.md, and agent config files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md)

## Graph Traversal

Queries use `context.yaml` as a lightweight graph index. Instead of loading all documents into memory, the engine evaluates selectors against metadata, traverses relationship edges for N hops via BFS, and only loads bodies for reached nodes.

```bash
ctx query "#engineering"           # Default: 2 hops from matched docs
ctx query "#engineering" --hops 4  # Deeper traversal, more context
ctx query "#engineering" --hops 1  # Shallow, fastest
ctx query "#engineering" --full    # Legacy: load everything
```

Edge priorities:
- `depends_on` edges are always traversed (free)
- Edges to hub nodes (most-referenced docs) are free
- `reference` edges cost 1 hop
- Set `metadata.edge_priority: 0` in frontmatter to make edges from that doc free

## Selectors

```bash
ctx query "#engineering"                   # All docs with a tag
ctx query "type:document"                  # All docs of a type
ctx query "type:skill"                     # All skill nodes
ctx query "type:skill + #engineering"      # Engineering skills only
ctx query "pack:engineering-essentials"    # All docs in a pack
ctx query "status:published"              # By status
ctx query "#api + #v2"                    # Union
ctx query "#api + status:published"       # Intersection
```

## Cloud Packs

Query context from cloud-hosted packs without downloading source files:

```bash
ctx query @promptowl/executive-ai-strategy
```

## AI Agent Integration

Running `ctx index` auto-generates config files so AI tools discover your vault:

| File | Tool |
|------|------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot |

Your hand-written content in these files is preserved — only the Context Nest section (between markers) is updated.

## MCP Server

For direct AI agent access via the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
npm install -g @promptowl/contextnest-mcp-server
```

See [@promptowl/contextnest-mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@promptowl/contextnest-mcp-server) for setup instructions.

## Syncing with PromptOwl

The CLI is local-first — a fully-authored vault lives on your
disk as `CONTEXT.md` + `nodes/*.md`. But once you want
governance, collaboration, approval workflows, or metered
third-party access, you can sync that same vault to the
[PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai) platform.

The PromptOwl side exposes three endpoints the CLI can target:

| Flow | Endpoint | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| **Push** local vault as a new nest | `POST /api/data-room/nests/import` | Device token |
| **Pull** a remote nest back to disk | `GET /api/data-room/nests/{folderId}/export` | Device token |
| **Query** a published marketplace nest | `POST /api/marketplace/nests/{nestId}/query` | Consumer API key |

The spec-format payload (`CONTEXT.md`, `.context/config.yaml`,
`nodes/*.md`) is the same on both sides — anything `ctx export`
produces is ingestible by PromptOwl, and vice versa.

**Getting a device token**: log into the Hootie desktop app or use
the PromptOwl in-app settings to approve a device. The token is
long-lived, hashed at rest on the server, and revocable via the
PromptOwl Settings → Connected Devices page.

**Getting a consumer API key**: buy access to a published nest in
the PromptOwl marketplace. The key is scoped to exactly that one
nest and is read-only — it can `query`, nothing else.
