[ACTION REQUIRED — GENERATE CONTEXT.md]

Generate a CONTEXT.md file in this vault's root directory:
1. Ask the user about their specific use case, team, and what they want to capture
2. Generate a CONTEXT.md that includes:
   - The vault structure and ctx commands reference
   - Role-specific guidance tailored to their answers
   - A "Getting Started" section with their first 3-5 actions
   - Guidelines for how an AI assistant should interact with this vault
3. Write the file using the Write tool
